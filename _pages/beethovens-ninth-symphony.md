Our Symphony welcomes world-renowned violin soloist Cordula Merks, who travels to Merced from her posts as Concertmaster of the San Francisco Ballet and First Assistant Concertmaster of the Seattle Symphony.  Cordula began playing the violin at the age of six, and was accepted by the Young Talent department of the Royal Conservatory in The Hague at the age of 12.  Her lifelong mastery of the violin has carried her to concertmaster positions with Germany’s Essen Philharmonic, Bochum Symphony, and Bergische Symphony, in addition to concert appearances around the United States and Europe.

# Cellist Amos Yang

Amos Yang loves playing cello in his hometown of San Francisco and around Northern California.  Amos famously studied cello as a freelance musician in London, England before engaging in formal training at the Peabody School of Music in Baltimore and at the University of Iowa.  He served as a member of the Seattle Symphony from 2002-2007 before joining the San Francisco Symphony in 2007.  During summers, Amos plays principal cello for the Sun Valley Music Festival.  Born and raised in the Richmond District, Amos learned how to ride a bike in Golden Gate Park, attended Lowell High School, sang in the San Francisco Boys Chorus, and supported the Warriors before they began dominating the NBA.
