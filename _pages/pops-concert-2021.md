# Pops Concert 2021

**Pops Concert Streaming Live Friday, March 5, 2021 @ 7:00 PM**

Watch this concert on demand after March 5th at [bit.ly/MSAtube](https://bit.ly/MSAtube).

The Merced Symphony’s first-ever virtual season continues with our annual Pops Concert broadcast live from the Merced Theatre stage!  Featuring Max Richter’s *Recomposed* version of Vivaldi’s *Four Seasons*, this performance promises a dramatic score you will recognize from popular film and television, most recently the hit Netflix series *Bridgerton*.  The concert then reaches its apex with an enchanting violin solo by Liana Berube as she interprets *Largo* from *Sonata No. 3* by Johann Sebastian Bach!

Please tune in **Friday, March 5 @ 7:00 PM** to Comcast channel 97, AT&T U-verse channel 99, MSA’s [YouTube channel](https://bit.ly/MSAtube), MCOE’s Facebook and YouTube accounts, and at [www.mcoe.org/metv](https://www.mcoe.org/metv).

MSA thanks its collaborators at the Merced County Office of Education, Magik*Magik Orchestra, City Church of San Francisco, and the Merced Theatre Foundation.
