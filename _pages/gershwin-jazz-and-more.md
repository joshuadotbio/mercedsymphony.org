Patrice Stribling Nelson is a classical pianist who has appeared with symphony orchestras across the United States.  An award-winning veteran of professional and college theatre, Patrice has served as Music Director in theatres from California to New York, including **The New Daisy Theatre** on Beale Street in Memphis and the **Young Vic** in Baltimore.  A native of Merced, Patrice returned in 2005 to teach at Merced College and to open the Stribling Nelson Music Studio.  She is the Founding Director of the Merced Children’s Choir at Merced College, and established Merced’s first Musikgarten, a developmental program for newborns through five-year-olds, centered in music and movement.  Patrice and her husband, celebrated Merced musician, educator, and actor Curtis Nelson, retired to Pennsylvania in 2019.

This performance with the Merced Symphony is very special to Patrice, as her mother, Lorraine Murphy Wenrich, was among the co-founders of the Merced Symphony in the early 1950’s.  Patrice first appeared with Merced’s symphony in 1972 as winner of the Youth Auditions, and two of her piano students have also performed as winners of this young artists’ competition.  *Gershwin, Jazz & More!* marks her sixth appearance as a guest artist with the Merced Symphony, and she’s delighted to be on stage with us once more.
