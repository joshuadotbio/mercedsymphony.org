## Guest Pianist Ralph van Raat
Ralph van Raat helps audiences identify with modern day composers by adhering to a classical approach: he firmly believes that a strong sense of classical structure as well as a refinement of tone is essential in conveying the logic and poetry of any music, certainly including his repertoire of choice.  Van Raat has been completely fascinated by classical music of the twentieth century since the age of 14.  Although his repertoire ranges from Bach to Boulez, his primary focus has always been on composers dating from Debussy, Bartók, and Ives to present day masters.  He aims to convince his audiences of the immense beauty and diversity of music of our own time through solo recitals, lecture-recitals, concerto performances, CD-releases and special projects.

Pianist and musicologist Ralph van Raat studied the piano with Ton Hartsuiker and Willem Brons at the Conservatory of Amsterdam and Musicology at the University of Amsterdam, graduating cum laude.  He won First Prize at the International Gaudeamus Interpreters Competition in 1999, Van Raat has won a large number of prizes and awards over his celebrated career.
