      The Merced Symphony’s first-ever virtual season continues with our annual Pops Concert broadcast live from the Merced Theatre stage!  Featuring Max Richter’s <em>Recomposed</em> version of Vivaldi’s <em>Four Seasons</em>, this performance promises a dramatic score you will recognize from popular film and television, most recently the hit Netflix series <em>Bridgerton</em>.  The concert then reaches its apex with an enchanting violin solo by Liana Berube as she interprets <em>Largo</em> from <em>Sonata No. 3</em> by Johann Sebastian Bach!
