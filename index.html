      We close out the 64th Anniversary season with two momentous works, Camille Saint-Saëns' grand <em>Organ Symphony</em> and the Brahms <em>Double Concerto for Violin and Cello</em>. Hear this immense, grand and sweeping symphony of Saint-Saëns as we close out the season with one of the fullest orchestras on stage. Soloists Cordula Merks and Amos Yang come from the San Francisco Symphony and San Francisco Ballet and perform the fiendishly difficult but beautiful Brahms <em>Double Concerto</em>. An exciting way to finish out the year, this will be a concert, and a season, not to miss!
